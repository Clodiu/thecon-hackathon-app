# Project Description
**"Take a break" is a mobile application developed with React Native that serves as an interactive guide to various locations like cafes, restaurants, and points of interest. It's designed to provide users with not just static information but also a dynamic, AI-generated "vibe" for each place, helping them discover the perfect spot for any occasion.**

**Made in less than 24 hours. One man army.**

# ⭐Core Features

**🗺️ Interactive Location Details:** Users can view detailed information about each location in a sleek, draggable modal interface.

**🤖 AI-Powered Descriptions:** A standout feature is the integration with Google's Gemini AI. With a single tap, users can generate a creative and atmospheric description (a "vibe") for any location, going beyond the standard summary.

**📩 Direct Booking via WhatsApp:** The app simplifies making reservations by allowing users to open WhatsApp with a pre-filled booking message.

**🎨 Modern & Themed UI:** Built with a clean, card-based design that supports theming (e.g., light/dark modes).

**🌀 Smooth Animations:** Utilizes react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for fluid animations and a native-like user experience.
